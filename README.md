- 👋 Hi, I’m @p4ulbong
- 👀 I’m interested in women, drinking, drugs, music, movies and taking over the world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning getting things done in the world is really way too hard due to bureaucrats.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on taking over the world.
- 📫 How to reach me smoke signals are a tried and true method.
- 😄 Pronouns: a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse (e.g., I, you) or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse (e.g., she, it, this).
- ⚡ Fun fact: Figs aren’t considered vegan because they have dead wasps inside.
