- 👋 Hi, I’m @p4ulbong
- 👀 I’m interested in women, drinking, drugs, music, movies and taking over the world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning getting things done in the world is really way too hard due to bureaucrats.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on taking over the world.
- 📫 How to reach me smoke signals are a tried and true method.
- 😄 Pronouns: a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse (e.g., I, you) or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse (e.g., she, it, this).
- ⚡ Fun fact: Figs aren’t considered vegan because they have dead wasps inside.

# Projects:

- AI Level 1
To achieve this level of AGI, we have to abandon the parrot-bot used by LLMs and their breathren and move on to a new paradigm that allows the AI to actually learn new information, build stronger connections for more important informationm layer the information on top of "neurons" like the human brain does and only retain the information that is important and cannot be retrieved/relearned.
- [ ] Better write up
- [ ] Add the math to show how it works
- [ ] Prove the math if possible

- AI OS
To allow an AGI program to be as powerful as it can be, the OS has to get out of the way and only provide the absolute minimum services.  This might be a good OS to make using micro-services.
- [ ] Better Write Up

- Highly Distributed Filesystem
A filesystem that can use the extra space on all the computers in an area maintaining a RAID1/RAID5 layout.  Included are an evacuate option to get the data off a drive/computer for upgrade/maintenance/replacement
- [ ] Write Up

- AI Language
In order to make it possible to program an AGI entity, there will need to be a programming language with the fundamental building blocks the fit with the paradigm.
- [ ] Write Up
- [ ] Syntax

- AI-Defender
- AI-Attacker
- Neuralyzer
- Memory-Tracking
- [ ] Write up
- [ ] Prove the Math
- Death-Swarm
- [ ] Write Up
- Easy-Cluster-Tools
- [ ] Write Up
- [ ] Structure analysis
- Guard-Transformer
- AI Level 2
- AI Level 3
